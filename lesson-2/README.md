The second principle of Redux is that the state is read only. The only way to change the state tree is by dispatching an action. An action is a plain JavaScript object, describing in the minimal way what changed in the application. Whether it is initiated by a network request or by user interaction, any data that gets into the Redux application gets there by actions.
